# Snake Game
This is a classic snake game written in C++. In this game, you control a snake to eat food that appears on the screen. Each time you eat a piece of food, the length of the snake increases and you get points. However, be careful not to let the snake hit the edge of the screen or its own body, otherwise, the game will end.

## Features
Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
The game speed will gradually increase as the score increases.
Food will appear randomly at another location on the screen after the snake eats it.
## Environment
Windows operating system
GCC and CMake must be installed
